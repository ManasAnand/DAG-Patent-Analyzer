# DEVELOPMENT LOG

## WEEK 1 (APRIL 11 - 18)
Our team met to discuss preliminary design decisions for the project. We started to develop the overall skeleton for the project framework such as the catch files, png classes, and our rough graph class skeleton for our implementation of one of our algorithms. Moving onto the second week of the project, our team will continue to build upon building the graph.cpp algorithm and reconfigure our makefile setup as we were not able to resolve the make file configurations yet. We hope to make continuing progress before our mentor check in meeting

## WEEK 2 (APRIL 18 - 25)
