# RESULTS
Overall, our team accomplished our goals

We were able to implement the algorithms we wanted to, as our Breadth Traversal and Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm are able to recognize the different paths in the graph.
 
The program traverses through the dataset and creates a subgraph that starts at the user-specified patent number. It returns the betweenness centrality of each node of the subgraph as well as the lowest weighted path.
